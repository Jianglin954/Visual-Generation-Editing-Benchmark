## Dataset

This benchmark organizes evaluation data with a strong emphasis on **prompt quality**, **semantic diversity**, and **reproducibility**.

### Prompt Collection

The following prompts are derived from canonical academic literature and are designed to test a model’s ability to capture **semantic structure, compositionality, and abstract concepts**.

1. **Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition**  
   *Kaiming He et al., CVPR 2016*  
   [[PDF]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7780459)

> More prompts will be added progressively to cover different abstraction levels, visual styles, and reasoning complexity.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Expand prompt set with fine-grained semantic controls  
- [ ] Add standardized evaluation metrics (FID, CLIP-Score, human preference)  
- [ ] Include model configuration and inference settings  
- [ ] Provide reproducible evaluation scripts
